      <p>
        I am Nico Del Rosario, I am a student in the Polytechnic University of
        the Philippines, I constantly set goals for myself so that I have
        something to strive toward. I am not comfortable with settling, and I am
        always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am results-oriented, constantly checking in with the goal to determine
        how close or how far away we are and what it will take to make it
        happen. I find this pressure inspiring and a great motivator for the
        rest of the team.
